### Landing Page

When you first bring up the application, you will see the landing page that provides a brief introduction to Weekend Warrior:

### Register
If you do not yet have an account on the system, you can register by clicking on “Login,” then “Sign Up:”

### Sign in
Click on the Login link. Then click on the Signin link to bring up the Sign In page which allows you to login:

### User home page
After successfully logging in, the system takes you to your home page. It is just like the landing page, but the NavBar contains links to list contact and add new contacts:

<img src="doc/userpage.png" style="box-shadow: 0px 6px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4); border-radius: 4px;" alt="User Home Page Screenshot">

### List Contacts
Clicking on the List Contacts link brings up a page that lists all of the contacts associated with the logged in user:

<img src="doc/contacts.png" style="box-shadow: 0px 6px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4); border-radius: 4px;" alt="List Contacts Page Screenshot">

This page also allows the user to add timestamped “notes” detailing interactions they’ve had with the Contact. For example:

<img src="doc/note.png" style="box-shadow: 0px 6px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4); border-radius: 4px;" alt="Notes Section Screenshot">

### Add Contacts
From the Home page or List Contacts page, the user can click the "Add Contact" link to bring up a page that allows them to enter new contact information. This page includes fields for the contact's first and last names, address, image, and description. After filling out the form, the user can save the new contact, which will then appear in the list of contacts.

<img src="doc/add.png" style="box-shadow: 0px 6px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4); border-radius: 4px;" alt="Add Contact Page Screenshot">

### Edit Contacts
From the List Contacts page, the user can click the “Edit” link associated with any Contact to bring up a page that allows that Contact information to be edited:

<img src="doc/edit.png" style="box-shadow: 0px 6px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4); border-radius: 4px;" alt="Edit Contact Page Screenshot">

### Admin mode
It is possible to designate one or more users as “Admins” through the settings file. When a user has the Admin role, they get access to a special NavBar link that retrieves a page listing all Contacts associated with all users:

<img src="doc/admin.png" style="box-shadow: 0px 6px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4); border-radius: 4px;" alt="Admin Page Screenshot">
